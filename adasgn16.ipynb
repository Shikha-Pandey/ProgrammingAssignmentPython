    "Q1. What is the benefit of regular expressions?\n",
    "\n",
    "A1. Regular expressions are a powerful tool used for searching, replacing, and validating text based on patterns. They provide several benefits such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Efficient pattern matching: Regular expressions allow for complex pattern matching with a few lines of code, making it easier to search for specific patterns within large amounts of text.\n",
    "2. Flexibility: Regular expressions offer a high level of flexibility by allowing you to create complex patterns that can match a wide range of text formats and variations.\n",
    "3. Reusability: Once a regular expression pattern is created, it can be reused in multiple scripts or applications, saving development time and effort.\n",
    "4. Portability: Regular expressions can be used in multiple programming languages and text editors, making them a widely accepted standard for pattern matching.\n",
