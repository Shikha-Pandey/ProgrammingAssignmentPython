    "A1. The key difference between __getattr__ and __getattribute__ is that __getattr__ is called only when an attribute is not found by looking up the normal places (i.e., the object's __dict__, its class, and its superclasses), whereas __getattribute__ is called for every attribute lookup. This means that __getattr__ is used for handling the lookup of undefined attributes, while __getattribute__ is used for intercepting all attribute lookups.\n",

The main difference between properties and descriptors is that properties define a specific behavior for getting, setting, and deleting attributes on an object, while descriptors provide a general mechanism for controlling attribute access. Properties are a type of descriptor, but they are limited to defining a fixed behavior for getting, setting, and deleting a single attribute on an object, while descriptors can be used to define more complex behaviors, such as attribute validation or lazy evaluation.\n",
