    "A1. Exception processing is a way to handle unexpected or erroneous situations in a program. Some common applications of exception processing are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Error reporting: When an error occurs, an exception can be raised to report the error to the user or developer. This can include information about the type of error, its location in the code, and any relevant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recovery and fallback: When an error occurs, the program can attempt to recover from the error and continue execution. For example, it may try to use a fallback method or provide default values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource management: Exceptions can be used to manage resources such as files, sockets, and databases. When an error occurs, the program can ensure that the resources are properly closed and released, preventing memory leaks and other issues."

    "\n",
    "A2. If an exception is not handled or caught, it will propagate up the call stack until it reaches the top-level of the program. At this point, the program will terminate with an error message, and any resources that were opened will not be properly closed, leading to potential issues such as memory leaks."

    "Catch the exception using a try-except block and handle it appropriately. This could involve logging the error, displaying an error message to the user, or attempting to recover from the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retry the operation that caused the exception, either immediately or after some delay. This can be useful in cases where the error was caused by a temporary condition such as a network outage.\n",
    "\n",
