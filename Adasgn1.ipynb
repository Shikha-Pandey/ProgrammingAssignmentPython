    "A1. The purpose of Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to create modular, reusable, and scalable code that allows developers to organize and manage complex programs more effectively. OOP provides a way to define and organize data structures and behaviors into classes and objects, making code more manageable and easier to maintain."
