Text files are files that store textual data encoded as a sequence of characters, whereas binary files are files that store non-textual data, such as images, audio, or video, encoded as a sequence of bytes. Text files are human-readable, whereas binary files are not. Text files are portable across different operating systems, while binary files may not be. Binary files can be more efficient in terms of storage and processing time than text files, but they are not human-readable.\n",
